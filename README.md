# **Discord-Bot**
A [Discord](https://discord.com) bot made in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/Ruby) with [discord.rb](https://github.com/shardlab/discordrb)

## **Introduction**
1. I'm a beginner on Ruby and even more with <strong>discord.rb</strong>.
2. If you have any advices to give me on my code, on the way to do it, the structure or if I don't respect some conventions. I'm a good listener and that's why you can join my discord and help me (So that I can improve a maximum !).
3. Thank you !
